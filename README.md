# ToDoListApp

<p>

  <b>Unfortunately, because Github Pages is best used to display
static pages, refreshing the page "To Do" and "Completed" always displays
404 Github pages error!</b>
</i>
</p>

App in Angular 15.2 with Firebase Realtime DB.
This app presents a different concept of Tasks Management.

If you want to check this application on live please visit this link:</br>
https://oleksy-piotr-angular.github.io/ToDoListApp/

App works with:

<ul>
<li>Router,</li>
<li>Reactive Forms,</li> 
<li>RxJS, Validators,</li>
<li>Angular Materials,</li> 
<li>Pipes,</li>
<li>Service Injection,</li>
<li>NgRX,</li>
<li>ngx-toastr,</li>
</ul>

A condition management strategy such as NgRx was used here.
To decrease the startup time, Lazy loading modules was used also here.

The goal of this task is to create a simple To-Do List application using Angular.

To initialize this application, you must have GIT installed on your computer

Then clone the repository here to your computer.

If you have Node Package Manager installed, just enter the following into the terminal in the path of this project:

"npm install"

After installing the packages, to run the Application, enter the following into the terminal:

"ng serve --open"

If necessary, please contact me by phone from my CV...

Due to the demo version, I cannot be responsible for the content of the "Task" element located in "githubPages" because anyone can post any content...
